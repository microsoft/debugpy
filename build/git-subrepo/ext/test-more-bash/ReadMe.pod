Test::More - TAP Testing for Bash

=for html
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/ingydotnet/test-more-bash"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/ingydotnet/test-more-bash.png" alt="test-more-bash"></a>

=head1 Synopsis

Write a test file like this. Maybe call it C<test/test.t>:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    TEST_MORE_PATH="/path/to/test-more-bash"
    BASHLIB="`
        find $TEST_MORE_PATH -type d |
        grep -E '/(bin|lib)$' |
        xargs -n1 printf "%s:"`"
    PATH="$BASHLIB$PATH"

    source bash+ :std

    use Test::More

    plan tests 8

    some-command
    ok $? 'some-command is ok'

    # or:
    ok "`some-command`" 'some-command is ok'

    pass 'This will always pass'

    fail 'This will always fail'

    is `echo foo` 'foo' 'foo is foo'

    isnt foo bar "foo isn't bar"

    like food foo 'food is like foo'

    unlike team I "There's no 'I' in 'team'"

    diag "A message for stderr"

    note "A message for stdout"

Run the test with C<prove> like this:

    prove test/test.t

Prove knows it's Bash from the first line (the hashbang), and it just works.

=head1 Description

Test::More is the tried and true testing library for Perl. It uses TAP (the
Test Anything Protocol). This is the same thing for Bash. For the most part it
should work exactly the same.

=head1 Methods
